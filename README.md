# Dreaming_in_the_sky
<h2>Introduction</h2>
On a summer afternoon, you lazily lie down by a tree, feeling the drowsiness creeping in... As you open your eyes, the large tree behind you has turned into a cherry blossom tree, and the scenery around you is as beautiful as a fairyland. Looking up, the sky has become as magnificent as the aurora. Feeling bewildered, you stand up, ready to explore the world in this dream... This is a first-person perspective sandbox game set in the sky islands. The game is built with the Unity3D engine, using the Universal Render Pipeline for rendering. It adopts a Low Poly visual style, making the game visuals more rounded and cute.
